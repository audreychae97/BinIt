## Description: 
BinIt is an Alexa Skill that aids the user in deciding where to dispose of
certain items.</br>

To begin interacting with this skill, the user can say 'Bin It'. Which then
Alexa responds with
``` Welcome to Bin It. The app that will tell you how to dispose of your garbage.Tell me what you need to get rid of.```

The user can then interact with the Alexa with questions such as 'Where would I throw a way a tooth brush?',
or inquiring questions like, 'Tell me more about recycling'.

If the user asks Alexa about an item Alexa is not familiar with, Alexa will ask
questions to find out more about the materials of the product (metal, paper, plastic) 
to try to guide the user in the right way.
